Please make sure that whatever is in "default.vcl" is what you want to be
the running config.  If you'd like to use another config, like drupal, please
copy over what is in default.vcl.

$ cp drupal.vcl default.vcl
$ git commit -a -m "replaced default vcl"
$ git push


Attention for Wordpress:

- Important, this wordpress vcl is based on https://github.com/dreamhost/varnish-vcl-collection 

1) Replace all values of "CHANGEME" in the wordpress.vcl and wordpress/static.vcl for your application name
2) You should install the "Varnish HTTP Purge" http://wordpress.org/plugins/varnish-http-purge/ plugin for auto invalidations
 	To reach a properly function please modify the value of "acl purge" in wordpress.vcl for the ip address of the node where your application is running on.
 	Varnish HTTP Purge requeries a special configuration on your wp-config, just add the lines below on top of your wp-config.php.

 	define('VHP_VARNISH_IP','VARNISH_APPLICATION_NAME');

 	Your should put the FQDN or the alias address of your Varnish application (remmember, Varnish is running on a different application of wordpress)
3) Copy the wordpress.vcl over the default.vcl

$ cp wordpress.vcl default.vcl
$ git commit -a -m "replaced default vcl for wordpress"
$ git push

That's it!
